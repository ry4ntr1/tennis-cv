# tennis-cv

1. Install Requirements
2. Get RoboFlow API Key and Set .env File
3. Run ball_detection.ipynb in ./training
3. cd into tutorial and run test_yolo_inference.py 
4. Upload this to cloud and run ball_detection.ipynb

Implementation
1. training/ball_detection.ipynb
2. training/keypoint_detection.ipynb
3. utils/video_utils.py
4. trackers/player_tracker (review, output detection avg precision and accuracy)
5. trackers/ball_tracker (review, output detection avg precision and accuracy)
6. keypoint_detection/keypoint_detection.py (review, output detection avg precision and accuracy)

To Do:
